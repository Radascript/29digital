#29Digital Animation Task List

- Hey, Rada.  So, here is your chance at a real world website - http://29digital.io 
- You will be integrating a JS animation library (Textillate) into a Bootstrap Theme. 
- Since you will be choosing the type of headline animation, you can put this website on your portfolio/resume as your freelancer/consulting work.  
- Contact me any time on Facebook if you have any questions.  
- There is no time limit on this.  I do not want you to feel any kind of pressure.  This is just an exercise for you to become familiar with a commercial project.  

###Objective
- Build the head banner section similar to 29digital.io

###Setup
- Login to Github.com
- Create an empty C9 workspace for Node.js
- Pull from https://github.com/29digital/task-animate into the C9 workspace
- If you are more comfortable with a local dev environment, then you can skip C9 and just pull it directly to your local setup.  Completely upto you.  

###Tasks

- Insert the logo.  Rip the png from 29digital.io
- Visit http://textillate.js.org/
- Learn the basics of Textillate
- Implement Textillate in your project
	* This maybe the hardest part for you.  On purpose, I am giving you no guidance, but if you get really stuck, don't hesitate to ask me for a hint.  Make sure you fully understand this step.  As you can imagine, being able to properly import a JS library into your website, and implementing is the key to all of this.  
	* The only hint I am going to give you for now is just this one word: JQuery.  
- Make both headline texts animate one after another like 29digital.io
- Make the animation loop
- Choose what you feel is the best animation sequence.  Maybe it will be a fade.  Or bounce.  Or pulse.  What do you think elevates the experience of the website?  

###Submission
- Push to a repository on YOUR OWN GITHUB ACCOUNT
- E-mail me the GitHub repository link at hello@29digital.io
- We will practice branching and pull requests at another time.  

###Extras
- If you think there is a better text animation library then Textillate.js, then by all means, go for it, and ignore the tasks above.  I'm very new to the world of animation, so I don't know what is hot and what is not.  
- I want to animate the logo in some way, but I don't know what would be the best.  Let me know if you can think of something cool.  Also, that logo is a totally temporary one that I made in 5 minutes last night.  It will change.
